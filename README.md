<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
<p>
<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Neelam Nagar</h1>
</p>

<p> <h3>
I’m a curious learner who enjoys exploring the world of <b>Machine Learning</b> and understanding how data can be used to solve real-world problems.
I like building things, experimenting with models (and sometimes breaking them 😄), and then figuring out how to improve them.
</p>
<p>
When I’m not working on ML projects, you’ll usually find me learning new concepts, strengthening my Python skills,
or experimenting with datasets to gain better insights.
</p>
<p>
Always learning, always improving—welcome to my GitHub!
</p>

<p> <h3>
I’m a curious learner who enjoys exploring the world of <b>Machine Learning</b> and understanding how data can be used to solve real-world problems.
I like building things, experimenting with models (and sometimes breaking them 😄), and then figuring out how to improve them.
When I’m not working on ML projects, you’ll usually find me learning new concepts, strengthening my Python skills,
or experimenting with datasets to gain better insights.
Always learning, always improving—welcome to my GitHub!
